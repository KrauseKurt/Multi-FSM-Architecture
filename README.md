# Multi-FSM-Architecture
## Unity3D project Multi-FSM Architeture
Multi-FSM is a Non-Deterministic FSM, 
The difference is you can run more than one state at the same time, but cannot run multiple of the same. (That is for my purpose, but it's easy to change).  


## I've been trying to 'recreate the wheels' here, the name was CSM(Caller System Machine) 
The purpose of CSM is handle the memory-allocated in the some functions calls(Async and Sync). It's just a simple AI, nothing special at all.
