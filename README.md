# Multi-FSM-Architecture
## Unity3D project Multi-FSM Architeture
Multi-FSM is a Non-Deterministic FSM, 
The difference is you can run more than one state at the same time, but cannot run multiple of the same. (That is for my purposes, but it's easy to change).  


## I've been trying to 'recreate the wheel' here, the name was originally CSM (Caller System Machine) 
The purpose of CSM is to handle with the memory-allocated in the some functions calls(Async and Sync).
