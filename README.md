# Multi-FSM-Architecture
## Unity3D project Multi-FSM Architeture
Multi-FSM is a Non-Deterministic FSM, 
The difference is you can run more than one state at the same time, but cannot run multiple of the same. (That is for my propouses, but it's easy to change).  


## I've trying to 'recreate the wheels' here, the name was CSM(Caller System Machine) 
The porpouse of CSM is an IA-like to handle with the memory-allocated in the some functions calls(Async and Sync).
